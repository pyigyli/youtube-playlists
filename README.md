Small web app that allows the user to subscribe specific Youtube playlists by their ids. The app is hosted at Firebase and uses Firebase for data storage. Project is working for it's purpose, but I'm planning on adding more features.

Note:
If you want to clone and use this app yourself, you'll have to change the name of *ApiConfigTemplate.ts* to *ApiConfig.ts* and add your own api keys and such.
Also, you need to generate your own firebase files.
